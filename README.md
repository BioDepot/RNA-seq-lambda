# RNA-seq-lambda


## Introduction

The scripts stored in this repository enable the use of AWS lambda functions to align 640 million reads with bwa in under 3 minutes - a process that takes bwa 20 hours when using a single thread.  An entire UMI RNA-seq pipeline converting fastq files to transcript counts takes under 20 minutes on a m4 4x large instance. This is 100x faster than the 30 hours needed for the original pipeline and 12x faster than a pipeline executed with 16 threads.

The repo contains the scripts used to execute the pipeline. Additional files that need to be uploaded to the s3 bucket are here:

This includes the executables and human reference files.

The RNA-seq pipeline itself is described in **Holistic optimization of an RNA-seq workflow for multi-threaded environments** [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz169/5374759](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz169/5374759) 
## Executables

The executables used in the lambda workflow are bwa  [https://github.com/lh3/bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) and 3 binaries umisplit, umimerge_filter, umi_merge [https://github.com/lhhunghimself/LINCS_RNAseq_cpp](https://github.com/lhhunghimself/LINCS_RNAseq_cpp) 

### umisplit 
demultiplexes the reads and separates the reads into smaller files. This needs to be compiled on the EC2 instance that will run umisplit.

### umifilter
This converts a SAM file formatted alignment into a hash value based on the gene that the read is aligned to and the position of the alignment. This is run on the Lambda functions and should be compiled on an instance with Amazon Linux (found in lambda functions). 

### umimerge
This dedups the reads with identical barcodes that map to the same position and produces the final set of transcript counts. this needs to be compiled on the EC2 instance that will run umimerge

## Scripts

### runPipeline.sh 
This shell script runs the pipeline on an EC2 instance and launches the lambdas.

### multidownload.sh
The script uses multiple threads to download the fastq files from S3 to the EC2 instance

### runSplit.sh
This script is a simple wrapper around umisplit executable on EC2. It is meant to be launched as a background process so that the upload of files can proceed as soon as a split file has been generated 

### runUploadSplitFiles.sh and uploadSplitFiles.sh 

These two scripts are used to upload the split files to S3. umisplit signals that a file is ready for transfer or that umisplit is finished splitting by writing special files. runUploadSplitFiles.sh checks whether umisplit has finished. If so it will call uploadSplitFiles.sh to upload the remaining split files to S3 and then terminate. Otherwise it will call uploadSplitFiles.sh, sleep for 1 second and check again whether umisplit is finished.

### invokeBwaLambdas.py
This script launches the Lambda functions, assigning to each Lambda, one chunked fastq file. It monitors the alignment output files to determine which lambdas have finished processing. When all files have been aligned, the script exits

### cleanup.sh  
This script removes all the files generated by the pipeline. 

### lambda_handler.py
This Python script is executed by each of the Lambda functions. A json payload informs the function as to which file should be aligned.
